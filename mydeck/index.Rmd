## Why R?

- It's open source
  + Why pay for licenses for other tools?
- There is lots of good documentation
  + Over 20 years worth!
- Extremely large and helpful community
  + Stack overflow is your friend

---
  
## Rstudio

- R is the language, but it can be pretty ugly to use
  + Similar to working in the CLI
- Rstudio is a IDE for R that will make your life easier
  + You can live without it, but why would you?

## Rstudio: The Console

<div style="position: absolute; left: 350px; top: 400px; z-index:100">
    <img height=200 src="https://github.com/jcampbellsjci/Class/blob/master/Week%201/Images/console.png?raw=true" alt="">
</div>

- The console is where we'll push code and see output
- We can type code directly into it
- The code we type in isn't saved!
  + We can go back in history, but it's not unlimited

---

## Rstudio: The Text Editor

<div style="position: absolute; left: 350px; top: 400px; z-index:100">
    <img height=200 src="https://github.com/jcampbellsjci/Class/blob/master/Week%201/Images/text editor.png?raw=true" alt="">
</div>

- Here we can load scripts directly into R
  + A script is a text file with code in it
  + Doesn't necessarily need to be R scripts
- We can push code to the console using that run button
  + Always easier to have that as a keyboard shortcut

---

## Rstudio: The Environment

<div style="position: absolute; left: 350px; top: 400px; z-index:100">
    <img height=200 src="https://github.com/jcampbellsjci/Class/blob/master/Week%201/Images/environment.png?raw=true" alt="">
</div>

- This is where we can see what is stored in our environment
  + Could be data, functions, models, etc.
- Essentially where what we save is stored
- Also includes a history tab for past code as well as a git staging area

---

## Rstudio: The Viewer Pane

<div style="position: absolute; left: 350px; top: 400px; z-index:100">
    <img height=200 src="https://github.com/jcampbellsjci/Class/blob/master/Week%201/Images/viewer.png?raw=true" alt="">
</div>

- The viewer pane has a lot of different functions
  + We can use it as a file viewer
  + This is where plots we create will show
  + This is where the help screen is

---

## Bare Bones R

- R can be used as a calculator
```{r}
1 + 1
25 / 5
4 * 3
```

## Assigning to Objects

- We can store different aspects of our work in objects
  + Data, output, functions, etc.
- Store what you want to keep, or else it's gone!

---

## Assigning to Objects

- We can use the assignment operator `<-` to store objects
```{r}
test_output <- 1 + 1
```
  + Might be more intuitive to use `=`, but that will cause confusion with function arguments (more on that later)

---

## Assigning to Objects

- `test_output` is now stored in our environment
- When we call `test_output`, it will show what we stored in it
```{r}
test_output
```
-We can also perform operations on this object
```{r}
test_output + 3
```

---

## Object Names

- We should be descriptive, but not overly-complicated with our object names
  + `foo` isn't descriptive and wouldn't mean anything to us
  + `test_output_from_model_1_set_b_where_i_added_a_variable` is way too complicated for a name
- Just be straightforward and succinct
  + `model_gbm` is probably holding a `gbm` model in it
    + Quick and to the point

---

## Functions

- Most of the time, we're going to be working with functions
  + Functions are predefined operations that perform some action
- Functions usually have arguments
  + Arguments are what we input into a function
  + The function takes this argument and provides output
- General function layout is `function(argument = x)`
  + We use `=` to assign input to an argument
